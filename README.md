# About the project
Hello to everyone viewing this repository. This is my first time experience creating a question like we see on codeforces. And to be honest, solving those questions is much easier than creating the same. At first, I wasn't able to understand anything. Then bit by bit, by reading blogs and watching some youtube videos I got an idea of what has to be done. And now, as I've finished making my first question, I'd like to say that it was a very very cool experience making this question and I hope I get to make more in the future. Now, let me briefly explain what I've done and the what all is needed for making a question using polygon.

Before jumping into the process, here is the link to my problem: [INVERTED MATH](https://polygon.codeforces.com/p3fEdnZ/Njoshi29/inverted)

## Statement
So, we start wth making the statement of the problem which is the first thing that we see when we begin solving this question. In polygon, you just have to go to the statement tab and fill up the boxes named name, input, output etc etc.

## Checker
Although this file is used when different answers are possbile for your question, I tried using it to make the question making process complete. However, I have used a custom checker that was provided by polygon itself.

## Validator
This part is very important as the job of the validator is to ensure that none of the test cases you have taken are invalid or violate the constraints of the problem.

## Generator
This is again a very important part as it deals with creating all the random testcases that we see. It was difficult understanding how this works but somehow, with a little help form here and there, I figured it out.

## Solution
Well, we all know what this is!
